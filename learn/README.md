# Markdown
Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to the human users in its source form. Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaboration software, documentation pages, and even readme files.
